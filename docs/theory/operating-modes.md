# Operating Modes

::: tip TL;DR
Choose `low-spec`, `standard`, or `high-trust` to set step budget, retry tolerance, and self-debug behavior for your hardware profile.
:::

Manna supports three explicit operating modes that scale step budgets, error
tolerances, and self-debug behaviour to match your hardware and trust level.

Set the mode via the `AGENT_OPERATING_MODE` environment variable.
The default is `standard`.

## Individual env-var overrides

Each limit can be overridden independently without changing the mode:

```bash
# Use standard mode but allow 30 steps
AGENT_OPERATING_MODE=standard
AGENTS_MAX_STEPS=30

# Use low-spec mode but allow 3 consecutive errors instead of 2
AGENT_OPERATING_MODE=low-spec
AGENT_CONSECUTIVE_ERROR_LIMIT=3
```

Individual env vars **win over** mode defaults when set to a positive integer.

## How the mode is resolved

At startup, `resolveOperatingModeConfig()` in `packages/shared/operating-mode.ts`:

1. Reads `AGENT_OPERATING_MODE` (default: `"standard"`, case-insensitive).
2. Looks up the mode-specific defaults from the built-in table.
3. Applies any individual env-var overrides.
4. Returns an `IOperatingModeConfig` object used by `Agent.run()`.

## Which mode should I pick?

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Hardware + latency budget}
    B -->|CPU only / small RAM| C[low-spec]
    B -->|General dev workstation| D[standard]
    B -->|Large GPU + long tasks| E[high-trust]
```

## Self-debug on step exhaustion

When the agent exhausts its step budget without completing the task:

- **`low-spec`** — skips the self-debug LLM call entirely and returns a
  generic fallback string. Saves tokens on hardware where every call matters.
- **`standard`** — runs a self-debug prompt using the `fast` model profile to
  summarise what was tried and suggest next steps.
- **`high-trust`** — same as standard (currently uses the `fast` model;
  switching to `reasoning` is a planned upgrade).
