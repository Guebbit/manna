# Quickstart: Your First Run

::: tip TL;DR
Three commands to start, one `curl` to prove it works. You only need one Ollama model.
:::

This guide gets you from zero to a working agent response as fast as possible.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node.js** | 20+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **Ollama** | any | [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) |
| **npm** | bundled with Node | — |

Docker / Qdrant are **not** required for a first run. The agent degrades gracefully when they are absent (local in-memory recall only).

---

## Step 1 — Pull one model

You only need a single Ollama model to start. `llama3.1:8b` is the recommended baseline:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest   # for semantic memory — takes ~300 MB
```

If you have less than 8 GB RAM, use `llama3.2:3b` instead.

---

## Step 2 — Minimal configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The only variables you need to touch are already set at the top of `.env.example`:

```bash
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text:latest
```

That is it. Leave everything else as-is for a first run.

::: tip Hardware-constrained?
Add `AGENT_OPERATING_MODE=low-spec` to cap the agent at 5 steps and reduce resource usage. See [Operating Modes](./theory/operating-modes.md).
:::

---

## Step 3 — Install and start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
{"message":"Server started","url":"http://localhost:3001"}
{"message":"ollama_configured","ollamaBaseUrl":"http://localhost:11434"}
```

If the server fails to start, check the error message — it will name the missing variable and link to this guide.

---

## Step 4 — Your first request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task":"What test framework does this project use?"}'
```

**Expected response** (formatted for readability):

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "status": 200,
    "message": "",
    "data": {
        "result": "This project uses **vitest** as its test framework..."
    },
    "meta": {
        "startedAt": "2026-05-12T14:00:00.000Z",
        "durationMs": 2100,
        "model": "llama3.1:8b",
        "steps": 2,
        "toolCalls": 1,
        "contextLength": 641
    }
}
```

What happened under the hood:
1. The agent read `package.json` to find the dependencies.
2. It identified `vitest`, composed the answer, and returned.

See the [full example walkthrough](./examples/read-and-answer.md) if you want to understand each step in detail.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Missing required environment variable: OLLAMA_MODEL` | `.env` not copied | `cp .env.example .env` |
| `ECONNREFUSED http://localhost:11434` | Ollama not running | `ollama serve` |
| Response takes > 60 s | Model too large for your RAM | Use `llama3.2:3b` or add `AGENT_OPERATING_MODE=low-spec` |
| `Unable to resolve model` | `OLLAMA_MODEL` is set to a model not pulled | `ollama pull <model>` |
| Empty or garbled answer | Weak model | Try a larger or instruction-tuned model |

---

## What to try next

All of these work without write access (`allowWrite` defaults to `false`):

```bash
# Explore the project structure
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task":"List all the TypeScript packages in this project and describe what each one does."}'

# Read and reason about a specific file
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task":"Explain what packages/agent/agent.ts does, in plain English."}'

# Inspect scripts and tooling
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task":"What npm scripts are available and what does each one do?"}'

# Understand the API surface
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task":"What HTTP endpoints does this API expose? List them with a one-line description each."}'

# Count and analyse tests
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task":"How many test files are in the tests/ directory? What areas are covered?"}'
```

::: tip Streaming variant
Replace `/run` with `/run/stream` for a [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) stream — useful for watching the agent think step by step.
