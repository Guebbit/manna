/**
 * Agent Quality Scorer — LLM-judge scorer for overall response quality.
 *
 * Uses a local Ollama LLM as an impartial "judge" to rate the
 * quality of an agent's response on a 0–10 scale, then normalises
 * the score to the standard [0, 1] range.
 *
 * **Local-first**: no cloud API key required — the judge calls
 * Ollama directly.  Configure the judge model with the
 * `EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL` environment variable.
 *
 * Falls back to a keyword-based heuristic when Ollama is unavailable
 * so that evals can still run in offline environments.
 *
 * ## Metadata keys read
 * - `metadata.maxStepsReached` (boolean) — hard penalty if `true`.
